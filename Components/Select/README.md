# Select (Dropdown)

The need for a custom Vue based select set up arose from needing to add icons and custom HTML into the options.

This allows for reactive components to be used in the `option` and `selected` slots by passing in the templates needed.

### Features & Capabilities:

- `v-closable` - A directive to handle clicking outside of a dropdown.
- Support for keyboard navigation via tabs for improved accessibility.
- Makes use of `perfect-scrollbar` for a customisable scroll indicator.
