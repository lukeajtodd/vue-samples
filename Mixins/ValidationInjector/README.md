# Validation Injector

Making use of the wonderful VeeValidate package for validation.

The concept behind this mixin was to control when the automatic validation would kick in for a form.

This mixin will after first submit re-engage VeeValidate's `onchange` validation. Then if validation is successful fire off a formHandler method on the component this mixin is attached too.
